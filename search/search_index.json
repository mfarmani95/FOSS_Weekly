To illustrate, when a precipitation occurs and the near-surface soil moisture increases, start of the perturbation, the increased moisture will diminish gradually due to evaporation to atmospheric, flux exchange, or draining to the deeper soil. So the loss of water is consist of several stages respectively: 1) right after precipitation occurrence and saturating the surface soil moisture, the soil is not capable of keep water (having water higher than field capacity, \u03b8_fc) and so the surface runoff and drainage happens; 2) having intermediate soil moisture, belove the \u03b8_fc and above the critical point, \u03b8_c, in this situation the moisture in the soil is higher the potential evaporation, hence the evaporation happens in the maximum rate, called Stage-I ET; 3) as the evaporation continues and the moisture available in the soil goes below the critical point, the water available in the soil is lower than potential evaporation, the evaporation happens in water-limited rate which is determined by SM, named as Stage-II ET; 4) finally, the loss of water will be stopped as the SM goes below the soil wilting point \u03b8_w. As explained the whole process of losing water by soil, Loss Function, can be considered as function as SM, which can be divided into two major categories, energy-limited and water-limited, Figure 1. The energy-limited processes, which encompass drainage and stage-I ET, occur on timescales ranging from hours to a few days. Conversely, water-limited processes unfold over longer durations, including weekly, monthly, and seasonal timescales. Conventional methodologies for quantifying soil moisture memory, predicated on the principles of the Markov process and often constrained by coarse temporal resolution data, typically conflate these two distinct hydrometeorological phenomena\u2014energy and water limitations. The innovative hybrid model formulated by McColl et al. (2019), however, proficiently differentiates the memory associated with each regime by incorporating three-day soil moisture data from the SMAP satellite. This nuanced Soil Moisture Memory (SSM) approach provides a robust benchmark, thereby substantially improving the capacity of Land Surface Models (LSMs) to calibrate their parameterizations of soil moisture dynamics under diverse environmental conditions. </p> <p>Figure 1 Schematic diagrams of (a) surface water loss process and (b) soil moisture memory at different soil moisture regimes [adapted from (McColl et al. 2017b)]. Note that the x-axis in panel (a) refers to SM (m3m\u22123), and y-axis refers to surface water lose rate, L(\ud835\udf03) (mm/s) ; Emax is the maximum evaporation rate (mm/s ). In panel (b), x-axis refers to time (e.g., days) and y-axis refers to SM content (m3m\u22123). \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc64 , \ud835\udf03c, and \ud835\udf03fc refers to the wilting point, critical point, and field capacity, respectively.</p> <p>We expound upon the concept of soil moisture memory as it pertains to two distinct regimes: the water-limited regime (\u03c4_L), where 'L' denotes the protracted temporal scale that is characteristic of water-limited processes, and the energy-limited regime (\u03c4_S), with 'S' indicating the abbreviated temporal scale inherent to energy-limited processes. This delineation is grounded in the framework proposed by McColl et al. (2019). Their hybrid model integrates a deterministic equation to faithfully represent the water-limited process, which benefits from the extended temporal span that satellite datasets can monitor and reflect. In contrast, the energy-limited process, constrained by a narrower temporal window, poses significant observational challenges for current satellite technologies to accurately characterize. To address this gap, McColl et al. (2019) introduced a stochastic equation tailored to encapsulate the dynamics of this transient process, thereby providing a robust methodology to elucidate the intricacies of this energy-limited regime that were previously unresolved.  The hybrid model is as follow:</p> <p></p> <p>where, \u03b8 is the volumetric soil moisture, P indicates the occurrence of precipitation, \u03b8_w is a minimum soil moisture, \u03b8 \u0305 is the time average SM, and \u03b5(t) is an independent and identically distributed random variable with a mean of zero, \u03c4_L and \u03c4_S are SSM for the water-limited and energy-limited regimes, respectively. McColl et al. (2019) solved the equations and showed that the memories can be expressed as: </p> <p>where, \u2206\u03b8 is equal to the SM changes during the drydown event, \u2206t is the temporal resolution of the SM data, \u03b1 refers precipitation intensity, and (\u3016\u2206\u03b8\u3017_+ ) \u0305  = \u03b8(t) - \u03b8(t-\u2206t) refers to a positive increment in soil moisture. </p> <p>In the analysis of water-limited memory, we employed Equation 2, fitting it to the soil moisture time series over a specified drydown interval, thereby extracting \u03c4_L as a parameter intrinsic to the fit. In contrast, short-term memory was ascertained directly from the application of Equation 3. For the computation of long-term memory, which operated under the presumption of no precipitation, soil moisture data was considered as the primary input. However, to accurately assess the memory from the energy-limited stage, it was necessary to combine both rainfall and soil moisture data to completely understand the complex interactions that controlled this phase.</p>"},{"location":"methods/#references","title":"references","text":"<p>Mccoll, Kaighin A., Qing He, Hui Lu, and Dara Entekhabi. 2019. \u201cShort-Term and Long-Term Surface Soil Moisture Memory Time Scales Are Spatially Anticorrelated at Global Scales.\u201d Journal of Hydrometeorology 20(6):1165\u201382. doi: 10.1175/JHM-D-18-0141.1.</p> <p>McColl, Kaighin A., Wei Wang, Bin Peng, Ruzbeh Akbar, Daniel J.
