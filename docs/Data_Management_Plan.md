# Data Management Plan

This document takes into consideration data that *would* be collected and made available for the land surface community to use.

## 1. Data Description
We will collect IMERG and PRISM precipitation data for CONUS. The data will include half-hourly precipitation from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) covering the entire continent of the US, and using machine learning techniques, these 0.1˚*0.1˚ rainfall data will be downscaled to 1 km * 1 km resolution to be used by other researchers.
## 2. Data Collection
These data are available online in NASA data repository, which can be accessed by everyone

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
The UofA HPC, 20TB, and Cyverse repository, 5TB, will be allocated for storing these data.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
The organization of the data will be input/output, and the data_name-specified input folder will house all of the input forcing files. Each dataset will have an accompanying metadata file detailing the data structure, variable definitions, and data processing steps. 
All the input data will have the metadata, and all the downscaled precipitation NC files will have them too.

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
There are a few ways to store long-term repositories; the most possible is to store them on a NASA repository for public availability.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
The data will be available after completing various evaluations and tests, and the reliability of the data has been proven.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
Ethics approval has been obtained for the study.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
The main role is to generate reliable data and publish it.

## 9. Budget and Resources
To be discussed.
