## Introduction
## Soil Moisture Memory
Soil Moisture Memory (SMM) denotes the period from when a perturbation begins to when it ends in the time domain. For instance, in a wet scenario, soil moisture (SM) diminishes due to atmospheric flux exchanges or drainage to deeper soil layers. This water loss process comprises several stages: immediate drainage and runoff when SM is saturated; evaporation at the maximum rate when SM is below saturation but still relatively high; evaporation at a water-limited rate when SM is lower; and cessation of water loss when SM reaches a critically low point. This entire process can be represented as a "Loss Function" which varies based on whether SM is in an energy-controlled state or a water-limited state. Traditional SMM methods using coarse temporal data often blur these stages, hindering model development. However, a newer hybrid method utilizing higher-resolution satellite data discerns between these stages, offering more precise references for model calibration, especially in diagnosing biases in Land-Atmosphere coupling.
