#  ðŸŸ¢ Objectives of the project

    *  Implementing the new parametrization of Noah-MP and assessing its accuracy in representing soil moisture
    *  Ensure the models do not overestimate streamflow
    *  Increase the accuracy of transpiration and evapotranspiration estimation

## What is the problem?
Many land surface models tend to overestimate soil moisture across CONUS. Soil moisture serves as a memory mechanism for the soil and directly influences both rainfall and streamflow

## So what is wrong with it? ðŸ¤”
