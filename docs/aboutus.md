## Introduction

The Project Governance guideline outlines operational protocols and regulations designed to elucidate and bolster NOAHMP improvement and its reference hub.

### Project Overview and Objectives

The complex processes of soil moisture dynamics pose significant challenges in understanding climatic, hydrologic, and ecosystem interactions. Many land surface models (LSMs) tend to overestimate surface soil moisture, soil surface evaporation, while underestimating soil surface drying rate. This study focuses on improving the representation of soil moisture dynamics and enhancing the partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) into transpiration (T) and evaporation (E) to strengthen ecosystem resilience. We leverage SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) observations to improve the Noah-MP LSM over the US continent.

#### Noah-MP

Noah-MP is a widely-used state-of-the-art land surface model used in many research and operational weather/climate models (e.g., HRLDAS, WRF, MPAS, WRF-Hydro/NWM, NOAA/UFS, NASA/LIS, etc.)
The official Noah-MP land surface model unified repository for code downloading and contribution is https://github.com/NCAR/noahmp. Noah-MP is a community open-source model developed with the contributions from the entire scientific community. For development, maintenance, and release of the community Noah-MP GitHub code, please contact: Cenlin He (cenlinhe@ucar.edu) and Fei Chen (feichen@ucar.edu).
