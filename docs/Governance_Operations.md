### Our Team

Meet the executive team:

- **Guo-Yue Niu**: Niu has been an associated professor at the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences (HAS) since 2019 Fall. He has served as the Director of the UA Hydrometeorology Program since 2014. He joined HAS in 2013 Fall as an assistant professor and joined Biosphere 2 as an assistant research professor, The University of Arizona since the fall 2009. He has been working on developing processe-based hydrometeorological and ecohydroligcal models for use in global-scale Earth system models and evaluating the impacts of climate change on ecohydrological processes at catchment scales. He obatined his PhD at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1996. His major research interests are hydrometeorology, ecohydrology, land surface modeling, distributed hydrological modeling, global and regional climate modeling, and application of remote sensing to modeling. He earned the CCSM (Community Climate System Model) distinguished achievement award by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in 2008 for his work on developing a novel surface water and groundwater model for use in CCSM and "Xuedu Fengzheng" best dissertation award by CAS in 1996. 
- **Ali Behrangi**: I joined the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Arizona as an associate professor in January 2018.  My doctoral work at the University of California, Irvine was on developing high-resolution precipitation products using satellite images and my postdoctoral work at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was on analysis of cloud and precipitation products from multiple sensors. As a NASA JPL scientist (2012-2018)  I was involved in several projects (as principal investigator or co-investigator) on various topics including precipitation retrieval, pathfinder for microwave sounding instrument, tropical cloud and precipitation, water and energy budget studies, GRACE based water storage anomaly, hydrologic modeling, extreme weather and climate studies, mission concept and proposal development, and using diverse data sets across multiple disciplines to quantify precipitation amount and distribution over cold regions(https://behrangi.faculty.arizona.edu/).
- **Mohammad Farmani**: I am Mohammad Farmani, a Ph.D. student in Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences department at the University of Arizona. I received my BS in Civil Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology and MS in Water Resources Management from Tarbiat Modares University. My academic journey has been characterized by a strong passion for comprehending the complexity of the natural world, with a specific focus on land-atmosphere interactions, urban flooding, and the application of machine learning and deep learning methods. My current research is centered around advancing our understanding of infiltration processes to enhance the accuracy of streamflow estimation.

## Operations

In order to ensure well distributed work loads across Noah-MP and the remote sensing team, we have outlined communications and procedure components in order to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.

### Communications

**Internal communications**: communications within the teams is carried out through private Zoom meetings.

**External communications**: communications within the teams is carried out through private Zoom meetings.
