### This is just a start, so just wait for the upcoming weeks

### Lets first get know each others.
I am Mohammad Farmani, a Ph.D. student in Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences department at the University of Arizona. I received my BS in Civil Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology and MS in Water Resources Management from Tarbiat Modares University. My academic journey has been characterized by a strong passion for comprehending the complexity of the natural world, with a specific focus on land-atmosphere interactions, urban flooding, and the application of machine learning and deep learning methods. My current research is centered around advancing our understanding of infiltration processes to enhance the accuracy of streamflow estimation. ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ’§
